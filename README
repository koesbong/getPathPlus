# jQuery getPathPlus

## Purpose:

I was working on a project where all I know was the element in which a certain text/selection lives in, but need to know the full selector between the known element and the closest element with an ID.  I found a code snippet written by [Andreas Blixt](http://github.com/blixt) and, with his permission, improved it.
    
## Usage:

    $(selector).getPathPlus(separator);

Sample HTML Code:

    <div id="main">
        <span>
            <p class="word">Word</p>
        </span>
    </div>
    

    $('.word').getPathPlus();
    >> "#main span p.word"
    
    $('.word').getPathPlus(' > ');
    >> "#main > span > p.word"
